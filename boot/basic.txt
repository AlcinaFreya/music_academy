<h2> Treble chef </h2>
<p>The treble clef is a tool musicians use to notate pitches above middle C on the piano. The treble clef is also known as G clef because it describes the location of G,
 specifically the G above middle C, or G4. We learn treble clef so we know how to read sheet music faster and easier.</p>

<h2> Bass chef </h2>
<p>The bass clef is shaped like an ornamental letter F, accompanied by two dots that bracket the music note F3, which is the first F below middle C. For this reason, it is nicknamed the F clef. 
The bass clef is the most common clef for double bass, bass guitar, trombone, and timpani.</p>
